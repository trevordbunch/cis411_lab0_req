**After talking with my roommate Jacob Siliman and my friend Mason Powers. They both specified that they would want a simple process to ordering food as follows:  to open application with menu greeted. Then go through menu and pick desired food. Put in room number. Pay with card or student account. Wait less than 15 minutes for food and eat.**

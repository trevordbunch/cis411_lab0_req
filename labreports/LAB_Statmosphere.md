## 1. Overview
In this section provides a brief overview of the business problem.  By brief, it should include a single image (business process or use case diagram) and a textual explanation (describing actors, tasks, information, or outcomes) and described in *Step 4*.

[Overview](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1VDu_ld4At0VCpFynmWMAJt0gCKbox0nXDtkzaEOdEm8)



## 2. Requirements
In this section, organize and list requirements from *Step 5*.  You are welcome to organize this section in anyway that you would like (using headings or tables).  The structure of this section should correspond to your overview section, and it is recommended that that you review the [lessons learned](../lessonsLearned.md) from your colleagues.

Students will be able to access the app via a website on their laptop or a mobile device. After logging in, they place an order and are shown its price. Payment will be automatically linked to their falcon dining dollars. They enter the location on campus they want food delivered to and an estimated wait time appears based on what they ordered and how many other orders are being processed. Orders are sent to a kitchen where the food is made. Food is delivered after wrapping it in towels and/or tin foil to keep it warm when it arrives.

## 3. Assumptions
This is an optional section, where system constraints, out of scope features or other caveats can be clearly documented.
